    The first innovation lab in Africa, Pulse Lab Kampala brings together
    data scientists, data engineers, partnership specialists, academics
    and technical experts to generate high impact data analysis tools to
    address development challenges. These innovative tools support UN partners
    and government in anticipating and responding to poverty, impacts of
    natural disasters, epidemics and food security by leveraging new sources
    of digital ‘Big Data’ (such as social media, mobile data, online
    information) and real-time analytics. Through partnerships, and in
    alliance with the Government, Pulse Lab Kampala acts as an ecosystem
    catalyst. In addition to keynoting regional conferences on data
    innovation, the Lab conducts learning sessions for UN partners and
    workshops for government and academic partners.
